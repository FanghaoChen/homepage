Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the National School of Development at Peking University. _**I'm seeking an academic position and available through the job market season 2021 fall to 2022 spring.**_ 

My research fields are development economics, international economics, urban economics, and industrial organization. The common thread of my research is in understanding the industrial development in China, with a particular focus on its relation to China’s increasing participation in international businesses via trade and FDI over the last decades. My current focuses are how Overseas Chinese pinoneered in a premature Chinese market, provided the seeding FDI, and facilitated the transition of China toward an open, market-oriented and properous economy. You can find my job market paper, _Familiar Strangers: Overseas Chinese, Lineage Connection and Foreign Investments in China_, [here](./assets/JMP_211104.pdf).
