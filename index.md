Welcome! I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics in the [School of Economics at Jinan University](https://ec.jnu.edu.cn/) and the Associate Director of the [Research Center for the Industrial Development of Guangdong and its Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan](https://ogo.jnu.edu.cn/). I obtained my PhD. in economics from the [National School of Development at Peking University](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/). I was a visiting scholar at the Department of Ecnomics at University of Toronto.

My research fields are the economics of international migration, the relationship between China and global economy as well as the economic history of Chinese diaspora. Currently, I am interested in topics such as the role of overseas Chinese in connecting China's economy with the global economy, as well as the relationship between China's industrial policies, industrial upgrading, and the international expansion of Chinese firms.
