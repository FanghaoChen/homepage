Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the National School of Development at Peking University. _**I will be joining the [School of Economics at Jinan University](https://ec.jnu.edu.cn/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in the fall of 2022.**_ 

My research fields are industrial economics and business economics. The common thread of my research is in understanding industrial development in an open economy, with a regional focus on China. My current focuses are how Chinese diasporas pinoneered in a premature market, provided the pioneering FDI into mainland China, and facilitated the transition of China toward an open, market-oriented and properous economy. You can find my job market paper, _Familiar Strangers: Lineage Connection and Diaspora Direct Investments in China_, [here](./assets/familiar_stranger_draft_220303.pdf).
