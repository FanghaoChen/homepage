Welcome! I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics in the [School of Economics at Jinan University](https://ec.jnu.edu.cn/). I obtained my PhD in economics from the [National School of Development at Peking University](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/).

My research fields are industrial economics, urban economics and international economics. The common thread of my research is in understanding industrial development across regions in China, and its relation to China's growing role in the global market. My current focus is to uncover the underestimated role of Chinese diasporas in facilitating China's transition from a closed state toward the second largest economy in the world. See [here](./assets/familiar_stranger_draft_2201010.pdf) for details.
