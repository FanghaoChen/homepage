Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the National School of Development at Peking University. _I am available in the job market 2021 for academic acpositions in Summer/Fall 2022_. 

My research fields are development economomics, urban economics, and industrial organization. I am commmitted to understanding the origin, proliferation, and evolution of Industrial clusters in China. My current focuses on how the presence of Overseas Chinese facilitated the transition for China to become an open, market-oriented and properous state. You can find my job market paper, _Familiar Strangers: Overseas Chinese, Lineage Connection and Foreign Firms in China_, [here](./assets/JMP_210820.pdf). 

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
