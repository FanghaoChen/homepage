Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the National School of Development at Peking University. _**I will be joining the [School of Economics at Jinan University](https://ec.jnu.edu.cn/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in the fall of 2022.**_ 

I'm broadly interested in the economic theory and empirics of firms, including but not limited to  development economics, international economics, urban economics, and industrial organization. The common thread of my research is in understanding industrial evolution in open economy, with a regional focus on China. My current focuses are how Chinese diasporas pinoneered in a premature market, provided the seeding FDI into mainland China, and facilitated the transition of China toward an open, market-oriented and properous economy. You can find my job market paper, _Familiar Strangers: Lineage Connection and Diaspora Direct Investments in China_, [here](./assets/familiar_stranger_draft_220303.pdf).
