<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the importance of international lineage network in facilitating the entry and survival of foreign firms in developing countries where formal institutions are largely immature. We build a unique dataset on the universe of foreign firms in China that are controlled by Huaren (overseas Chinese) during China’s Reform Era (1981-1996). To identify the causal effects of lineage connection, we exploit variations from both China’s stepwise openness and surname distributions across prefectures, to implement a Difference-in-Difference design with differential treatment to Huaren foreign firms whose legal representatives differ in their surnames, which allows us to control for unobserved factors at multidimensional level. We find that, following the local openness reform, lineage connection facilitates the entry and survival of Huaren foreign firms, through reducing information frictions, securing property right, and smoothing contract enforcement. And the lineage-driven FDI brings about an array of long-term economic benefits, including greater GDP growth, wage level, innovation, non-Huaren FDI inflows, export and import.
