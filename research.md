<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper develops an algorithm to predict the effect of influencer video advertising on product sales. We propose the concept of motion, a summary statistic that captures the extent to which the advertised product is shown in the most engaging parts of a video. We estimate pixel-level engagement as a saliency map by fine-tuning a deep 3D convolutional neural network on video-level engagement data. We locate product placement by matching product images to video frames with an object detection algorithm. Motion is then defined as the pixel-level, engagement-weighted advertising intensity of a video. Analogous to a fundamental law in Newtonian mechanics, motion (sales conversion) is generated when the object (product placement) is impressed with a force (content engagement) in the space and time (video). We validate the algorithm with an analysis of 40,000 influencer video ads on TikTok, the largest short video platform in the world. We leverage variation in video posting time to identify the causal effect of video ads on product sales. Videos of higher motion are indeed more effective in driving sales. This effect is sizable, robust, and more pronounced among impulsive, hedonic, and lower-price products. We trace the mechanism to influencers’ incentives to promote themselves rather than the products. We discuss how various stakeholders in the entertainment commerce space can use the motion metric in a scalable way to optimize video ads, to align incentives, and to improve efficiency.
