This paper studies the importance of international lineage network in facilitating the entry of foreign firms in developing countries where immature market environment deters foreign investments. We build a unique dataset on the universe of diaspora foreign firms in China that are controlled by overseas Chinese whose surnames are used to infer their lineage group. To identify the causal effects of lineage connection, we implement a Triple Differences design exploiting variations from both the staggered timings of opening shocks during the Reform Era (1981-1996) and differential surname distributions across prefectures, which allows us to control for unobserved factors at various levels. We find that, following the prefecture-level opening shocks, lineage connection facilitates the entry diaspora-run foreign firms, through information sharing and contract enforcement. Our findings are robust to various robustness checks and we find no such effects following China’s accession to WTO because market institutions had been much improved. We also find that the lineage-driven diaspora firm entrants during early development stages functioned as industrial seeds, as they generate large and long-term positive spillover effects on non­diaspora firm entry and investments.
