I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Xiaobo Zhang](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/jsjjxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1141&user_id=x.zhang) (Guanghua School of Management at Peking University & International Food Policy Research Institute) and [Loren Brandt](https://brandt.economics.utoronto.ca/) (University of Toronto). I'm also working with [Gilles Duranton](http://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/duranton/) (Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania & London School of Economics and Political Science & CEPR), [Lixin Colin Xu](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/l/l-colin-xu) (World Bank), [Shihe Fu](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pfu39.html) (Xiamen University) and [Jingjing Ye](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingjing-Ye-3) (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics) and many other aspirational young scholars. 

I'm affiliated with [_Center for Enterprise Research_](https://www.cer.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University and co-supervise _Enterprise Survey for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in China_ (ESIEC), a project aiming to maintain and update a random-sampled and national-representative longitude data set of small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SME) and their entrepreneurs in China in regard to SMEs’ start-ups, operation, performance, and growth.

I'm interested in working with more scholars and Ph.D. students who share similar interests or can access unique data sets to develop new research projects.
